#Detector Definitions
P_Array 0.028745 0.002788 0.513115 # 3 array defining the location of the detector. [meters] [See paper for definitions]
R_Array -1.20131258 -1.21399082 -1.21881158 # 3 array defining the orientation of the detector [See paper for definitions]
PxX 0.0002 # Horizontal pixel size [meters]
PxY 0.0002 # Vertical pixel size [meters]
NrPxX 2048 # Number of horizontal pixels
NrPxY 2048 # Number of vertical pixels

#Energy filtering
Elo 5 # Minimum expected energy [keV]
Ehi 30 # Maximum expected enegy [keV]

# What qualifies an orientation?
MinNrSpots 7 # Minimum number of spots in the first pass to qualify an orientation
MinGoodSpots 5 # Minimum number of good spots in the second pass to qualify an orientation [See paper for details]
MinIntensity 50 # Minimum total intensity from forward projection pixels to qualify an orientation
MaxAngle 5 # Minimum misorientation between grains to be detected.

# What qualifies a spot and image processing parameters
MinArea 5 # Minimum number of pixels that qualify a spot. Connected pixels smaller than this number will be set to 0.
Threshold 0 # If you want to apply a threshold. It will also compute the threshold automatically, and will use the higher of the two values. This is before gaussian blurring.
doWatershed 0 # If you don't want to do watershed to split overlapping peaks, put this to 0.

# Where to save results, which files to read etc.
ResultDir results_simulation # This directory will be created in the execution directory.
HKLFile valid_hkls.csv # The valid hkls will be saved / read from this file. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
OrientationFile /dev/shm/100MilOrients.bin # Orientations file, if this is in /dev/shm, it will memory map it, is very fast.

#Simulation Definitions
MaxNrLaueSpots 30 # For simulation, the maximum number of expected spots. This is used in the first pass only. The second pass during refinement uses 3x this number.
ForwardFile /dev/shm/Simulated_FwdSim.bin # Location where the forward simulation is written / read from. /dev/shm is recommended for performance.
OrientationSpacing 0.4 # Orientation spacing for the OrientationFile in degrees. This doesn't need to be exact, but should be close to what is used. 0.4 for the 100 million points.
DoFwd 0 # If you want to do forward simulation, put to 1. If the ForwardFile does not exist, it will automatically put this to 1 and run the simulation.
SimulationSmoothingWidth 2 # Only for generating a synthetic simulation image, it is the width of the Gaussian diffraction peaks.
